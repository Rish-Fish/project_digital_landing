Hi!
This is my "Digital landing" project. I completed it using html, css and js.
In this project I used:

- sprites
- picture tag for better performance in responsive design
- retina-ready images
- @font-face rule
- media queries to create adaptive screens
- flex-box to create responsive screens
- BEM
- connect slider library swiper.js
- added mobile menu in js
